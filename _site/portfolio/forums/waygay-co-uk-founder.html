<p>In 2003 during Jakeâ€™s time at university, a group of friends identified a need for an online peer support network for Lesbian, Gay. Bisexual and Trans* students. WayGay.co.uk was an online support forum allowing users to sign up, post stories of their experience and support others facing similar challenges. It also helped to unite university groups.</p>

<p>This was at a time when social media was not in existance. WayGay.co.uk users managed to post over 100,000 messages to the site, and was used by several UK university groups.</p>

<p>The project was awarded lottery funding from the Millenium Commision to help grow the site. The service briefly enjoyed support from the NUS LGBT campaign. Https://waygay.co.uk</p>
