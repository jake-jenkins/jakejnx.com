<p>Jake worked with the NHS provider to build and promote a teaser website to drip news about the new service, help get user testing and generate interest in the new service.</p>

<p>A co-ordinated social media campaign was also managed by Jake. The site recieved significant traffic and media interest. The service opened with overwhelming demmand on it’s first day and became the busiest clinic of it’s kind in the world during it’s first week.</p>
